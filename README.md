# Pull requests and GitHub issues
## PR's (sorry for spelling)
Pull requests (PRs) are like merging to main on Local, but better, since, in a collaborative setting, it allows for code review.
Let's say you made an important change worth being merged into main. You would inevitably push it to the remote development branch, and will see a popup that looks like the following image.
<br>

This pops up when the branch has something different in it from main. Click the Compare & Pull request button. This will take you to the window where you can describe what changes you made.

If you have protections set on main branch (ideally), you will not be able to merge on your own - your teammate will have to approve the merge (or, in work setting, a senior developer). Now create the pull request. The following window will pop up. If there are conflicts, which there are non atm, they would need to be resolved, but for simplicity, my change was just adding a comment.

<br>
Click merge.

And confirm. Now your remote has branches for development, and the main is up to date so your collaborators can pull the most recent changes on their local project.

## Issues
Think of issues as of a TODO list but in a GitHub fashion. Issues allow you to pile up your Project TODOs and ideas into one spot.
Let's create one<br>

The next screen will have a big green button that prompts to add a new issue, click it and add an issue.<br>
<img width="800" alt="Screenshot 2024-04-17 at 8 13 37 PM" src="https://github.com/Poleron402/ez_pts_sp24B/assets/89750832/10386b31-346d-4a1f-8424-44bfa72f17be"><br>
Make it descriptive. Now, upon accessing issues tab again, you will see a list of issues that need attention. <br>

We can assign that issue to someone to resolve, add flags, or resolve them later.

For example, one issue was to finish this readme, and I'll count it as documentation related. Some other issues could be solving a bug -- for example, imagine you have a null pointer exception occuring somewhere in your program. You can create an issue, tag it as a bug, and assign it to your teammate for resolution. <br>
