# Pull requests and GitHub issues
## PR's (sorry for spelling)
Pull requests (PRs) are like merging to main on Local, but better, since, in a collaborative setting, it allows for code review.
Let's say you made an important change worth being merged into main. You would inevitably push it to the remote development branch, and will see a popup that looks like the following image.

This pops up when the branch has something different in it from main. Click the Compare & Pull request button. This will take you to the window where you can describe what changes you made.

If you have protections set on main branch (ideally), you will not be able to merge on your own - your teammate will have to approve the merge (or, in work setting, a senior developer). Now create the pull request. The following window will pop up. If there are conflicts, which there are non atm, they would need to be resolved, but for simplicity, my change was just adding a comment.

Click merge.

And confirm. Now your remote has branches for development, and the main is up to date so your collaborators can pull the most recent changes on their local project.
